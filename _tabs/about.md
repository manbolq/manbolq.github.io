Hello!

My name is Manuel Bola√±os (aka manbolq), and I am currently pursuing a bachelor in Computer Science and a bachelor in Mathematics in University of Granada (Spain). 

For the last year and a half I have been learning about cybersecurity. I am really passionate about this field and I love learning about it!

When I have some spare time, I will try to upload new writeups, news, posts or whatever I think that is interesting. I really hope you like my blog. Thanks for reading :)
